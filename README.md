This handwritten digit recognizer can be used to recognize digits that are written by hand.  It is based on the MNIST dataset, which is a dataset of handwritten      digits that has been widely used for training and testing machine      learning models. The model that is used for recognition is a      convolutional neural network, which is a type of neural network that is well-suited for image recognition tasks.
